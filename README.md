5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified in the .env)

#### additional notes:
- You can delete the markers on map by clicking on them
- But it does not matter since Add Notes and Create Visiting Plans Does not work
- You can close the Landmarks and Visited Landmarks by clicking a empty space
